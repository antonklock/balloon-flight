# Heightmap Image Placeholder

This file should be replaced with an actual PNG heightmap image.

You can create a heightmap by:
1. Using a grayscale image where white = high elevation, black = low elevation
2. Using online heightmap generators
3. Creating one in image editing software like GIMP or Photoshop
4. Using procedural generation tools

For testing, you can use any grayscale image or the procedural terrain option in the TerrainGenerator class.

Recommended dimensions: 256x256 or 512x512 pixels
Format: PNG (grayscale)
